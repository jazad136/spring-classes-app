Saddler version of Classes App written with a Spring source code backend.

This repository contains the backend code for the Classes app, a webapp that helps course instructors host syllabi releases and course descriptions.

On the backend, you will be able to edit a JSON file, the application will pull in all descriptions from that file into a database, 
and have updates be seen in the frontend component, where the front-end developer can craft a structured experience.

See [react-classes-app](http://github.com/jazad136/react-classes-app) for the frontend designed for this application.
